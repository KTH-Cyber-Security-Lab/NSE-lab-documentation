You can find a complete list of previous projects, published theses and discovered vulnerabilities [here](https://www.kth.se/nse/research/software-systems-architecture-and-security/projects/ethical-hacking-1.914053).

## Published Theses
### *Ethical hacking of a Smart Automatic Feed Dispenser* by Julia Lokrantz
You can read the full thesis [here](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1561552/FULLTEXT01.pdf).

Excerpt from the abstract:

*"...the food-dispenser Trixie TX9 has insufficient encryption of network names and passwords, is susceptible to flooding-attacks, and analysis of the incoming/outgoing data traffic from the device can deduct which state it is currently in. Furthermore, the food dispenser has several open network services, Telnet is one among them, which can be accessed through weak, hardcoded credentials that are published on the internet."*

### *Where's My Car? Ethical Hacking of a Smart Garage* by Madeleine Berner
You can read the full thesis [here](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1464458/FULLTEXT01.pdf).

Excerpt from the abstract:

*"This thesis has evaluated the security of one particular smart garage that is being sold worldwide – iSmartgate PRO. Penetration testing was conducted with focus on the web application. A total of eleven vulnerabilities were reported, including a one-click-root attack that combined three of them into providing an unauthenticated remote attacker with a root shell. It was concluded that the product lacked security measures in certain areas."*

### *IoT Penetration Testing: Security analysis of a car dongle* by Aldin Burdzovic and Jonathan Matsson
You can read the full thesis [here](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1334244/FULLTEXT01.pdf).

Excerpt from the abstract:

*"The findings presented shows that there is a critical vulnerability in the system. The AutoPi can be exploited and full access of the devices can be granted. The paper also discusses what possible harm can be done through the found exploit."*

### *Security evaluation of smart door locks* by Arvid Viderberg
You can read the full thesis [here](https://www.kth.se/polopoly_fs/1.914054.1600689128!/Examensarbete%20Final.pdf).

Excerpt from the abstract:

*"...there are several deficiencies in today’s smart locks, where the most severe has been reported under responsible disclosure to the manufacturer. The locks investigated shows vulnerabilities in state consistency, password policies and password reset mechanism."*
