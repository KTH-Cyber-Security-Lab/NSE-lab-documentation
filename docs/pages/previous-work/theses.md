## *Ethical hacking of a Smart Automatic Feed Dispenser* by Julia Lokrantz
You can read the full thesis [here](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1561552/FULLTEXT01.pdf).

Excerpt from the abstract:

*"...the food-dispenser Trixie TX9 has insufficient encryption of network names and passwords, is susceptible to flooding-attacks, and analysis of the incoming/outgoing data traffic from the device can deduct which state it is currently in. Furthermore, the food dispenser has several open network services, Telnet is one among them, which can be accessed through weak, hardcoded credentials that are published on the internet."*

In this paper, we do a threat model and subsequent penetration testing on a smart plug system made by particular brand by exploiting its singular communication protocol and we successfully launch five attacks: a replay attack, a MCU tampering attack, a firmware attack, a sniffing attack, and a denial-of-service attack. Our results show that we can hijack the device or obtain the authentication credentials from the users by performing these attacks."*

A threat model was created where the online store’s assets and potential vulnerabilities were identified and ranked. The results of the penetration tests show that the online store has good security against some of the most common risks, this after typical hacking had been carried out on the store’s assets without finding a clear security flaw with a major impact."*

## *Race Conditions in Web Applications* by Agnes Altin and Veronika Nicolaou
Excerpt from the abstract:

*"This bachelor thesis examines how vulnerable web applications are to race conditions and how reliable existing methods are to detect them. The study includes research on the Web, web applications, security risks, race conditions, related work, and methods to detect race vulnerabilities. The research was followed by practical penetration testing of web applications using the software tool Burp Suite Professional with the extension Turbo Intruder."*

## *Are modern smart cameras vulnerable to yesterday’s vulnerabilities?: A security evaluation of a smart home camera* by Jesper Larsson
You can read the full thesis [here](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1602050/FULLTEXT01.pdf).

Excerpt from the abstract:

*"This thesis has performed a case study of a consumer smart camera popular on the Swedish market. The camera was evaluated through a pentest. The evaluation found that the camera’s cloud centric design allowed it to side step issues present in earlier models. However, it was demonstrated that it is possible to detect potentially sensitive events, e.g. when the camera notice motion, by just inspecting the amount of traffic it sends."*

Excerpt from the abstract:

*"... at least two instances where we were able to gain unauthorized access to data within our self-hosted GitLab instance. We also found that a new feature could be used for privilege escalation under certain conditions. We were then able to conclude that open source software and a prolific bug bounty program does not guarantee the security of GitLab, in and of themselves."*

## *Detecting plagiarism in penetration testing education* by Nikolaos Kakouros, Pontus Johnson, and Robert Lagerström
You can read the full conference paper [here](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1502462/FULLTEXT01.pdf).

Abstract:

*"Plagiarism in hands-on ethical hacking education is challenging due to student work being delivered almost exclusively virtually via actions on a cyber range. We are developing the Cheat Detection System, a solution that uses system administration and two approaches of log analysis to infer about the cheating behavior of students; one based on canary detection and another based on traces of student actions which we have termed the intrusion deficit approach."*

The method is based on threat modeling the device, using the DREAD and STRIDE models. The threats with the highest estimated severity were then penetration tested to see which security measures are implemented to protect against them. Using client side manipulation one vulnerability was found in Trifo’s mobile application ”Trifo home” which could be used to harm customers property."*

Excerpt from the abstract:

*"This thesis covers a security assessment of a smart lock, focusing on the firmware of the embedded devices as the main assets. Potential threats against obtaining and abusing the firmware are identified by threat modeling. Based on the identified threats, penetration tests are conducted to demonstrate the security of the firmware. The results show that the firmware could not be obtained and that the product constitutes a good example within consumer IoT for how to manage the firmware of embedded devices."*

## *The ADS-B protocol and its'weaknesses: Exploring potential attack vectors* by Andreas Sjödin and Marcu Gruneau
You can read the full thesis [here](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1464430/FULLTEXT01.pdf).

Excerpt from the abstract:

*"The ADS-B protocol is currently in use all around the world. The purpose behind the protocol is to give pilots and traffic control a better picture of the situation in the air. Previous research shows that there exists a vulnerability in the protocol since it lacks authentication. The protocol is solely built upon trust between sender and receiver.Our work is inspired by previous studies made in the area, where it has been demonstrated that one can inject fake aircraft by sending fake ADS-B data using the protocol."*
