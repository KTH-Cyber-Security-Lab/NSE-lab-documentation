# Hacking Guides

Reading [PatrIoT](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-022-00633-3) is usually a good starting point for hacking theses and projects. It presents the IoT pentesting methodology in detail.

Furthermore, [Penetration testing of Connected Households](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016740482200459X) provides examples of previous hacks that successfully found vulnerabilities in commercial IoT. 

For the curious reader, the [literature review on vulnerability assessments](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574013723000187) provides more inspiration of what could be hacked.
