# Ubertooth

## What is Ubertooth?
[The Ubertooth Project](http://ubertooth.sourceforge.net/) is an open-source platform used to experiment with Bluetooth. It can be used to capture and demodulate Bluetooth packets, and can be combined with packet analyzer tools such as [Kismet](https://www.kismetwireless.net/) or [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).

The latest version is the Ubertooth One. The lab has two such devices that you can either try out at the lab or borrow for a project.
The Ubertooth One is mainly used to sniff BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), but can in some cases also be used with BR (Basic Rate Bluetooth Classic).

You can find the GitHub repository for the Ubertooth [here](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth).
