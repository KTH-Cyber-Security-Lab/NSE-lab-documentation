# Bluetooth Primer
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGixQzBo7Y&list=PLYj4Cw17Aw7ypuXt7mDFWAyy6P661TD48) is a pretty good primer on the fundamentals of Bluetooth.

# Bluetooth MITM

Bluetooth can be intercepted with a couple of Bluetooth USB dongles and software such as [GATTacker](https://github.com/securing/gattacker) or [BtleJuice](https://github.com/DigitalSecurity/btlejuice), as detailed in [Melamed, An active man-in-the-middle attack on bluetooth smart devices, 2018](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322999675_An_active_man-in-the-middle_attack_on_bluetooth_smart_devices) and [Melamed, Hack-a-ble: Hacking BLE Smart Devices, 2017](https://youtu.be/5xJ_xeNJ3WU).
We can also use the [Ubertooth One](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/wiki/Ubertooth-One) to intercept Bluetooth signals from your target.

Bluetooth comes in two flavors, Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). [Here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLcFjjeNcUorRySbA8YTV0g/playlists) is a pretty good video introduction to BLE.

# SwaynTooth

Some interesting new vulnerabilities were discovered in February 2020. More information here: https://asset-group.github.io/disclosures/sweyntooth/
