# IoT pentest process - Reporting


## 3. Reporting
When the penetration testing is completed, the results are gathered in a report. The report should use a standardized structure in order to facilitate comprehension, analysis and comparison with other pentest projects. The [hacking thesis guidelines](/pages/thesis_guidelines/guidelines.html) describes how the thesis report should be structured. Please remember to document all tests, not just the successful ones. If no test is successful, it is still possible to write a valuable report (stating we could not find a weakness in the product). The ideal outcome is that each test (successful and unsuccessful) can be expressed as an attack graph with explanatory metrics such as TTC (Time To Compromise). In addition to this, if a previously unknown vulnerability is identified and exploited additional steps should be taken for [responsible disclosure](/pages/thesis_guidelines/responsible_disclosure.html).

### 3.2 Responsible disclosure
Please refer to the [thesis guidelines page](/pages/thesis_guidelines/responsible_disclosure.html) for more information on responsible disclosure. 





Public disclosure is the practice of announcing security vulnerabilities discovered in software or hardware products. While security researchers have a responsibility to disclose vulnerabilities, some precautions must be taken in order to minimize the risk of damages from the vulnerability, and to give the company a fair chance of correcting the problem.

Most industry vendors agree that a public disclosure time of 90 days is acceptable. Meaning the part that owns the vulnerable product has 90 days to correct the problem, before the vulnerability is shared with the public. More information can be found [here](/pages/thesis_guidelines/responsible_disclosure.html), in the [CVE page by Mitre](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/researcher_reservation_guidelines), or in [Google's project zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/).

### 3.1 Report template
An IoT pentest report can be divided in eigth sections.

1. “General Information” includes the service recipient, time period, systems that has been tested, and overarching information about the report.

2. The “Scope” identifies assets and test types (black box or white box testing etc.).

3. The “General Testing Methodology”, which describes the steps followed to perform

4. “Risk Assessment”, which defines the meanings of vulnerability severity levels.

5. “Executive Summary”, a one-page information on which systems were tested, what types of tests failed, what types of tests were successful, and what was done.

6. “Technical Summary”, which explains indetail the “executive summary”.

7. “Summarized Vulnerability Table”, that shows which systems have which vulnerabilities and their severity.

8. “Findings”, that details which vulnerabilities have been discovered on which systems. It contain a number of information for each vulnerability identified as follows. A brief description of the vulnerability, attack surface, attacker profile, the techniques used to find the vulnerability,
references to the identified vulnerability, impact and severity of the vulnerability, PoC scripts for
exploitation, screenshots, steps to reproduce exploitation, references for remediation.

For IoT pentesting reports, sections dedicated to hardware and radio components can preferably contain a high level of detail and include demonstrative pictures and/or videos.
