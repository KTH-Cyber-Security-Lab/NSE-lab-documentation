# Analyzing BLE

## 1. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) internals
* Attribute Protocol (ATT)
  * defines the client/server protocol for data exchange
* Generic Attribute Profile (GATT)
  * handles the entire exchange of all user data and profile information in a BLE connection
* Generic Access Profile(GAP)
  * responsible for all the discovery and related aspects in any BLE network

* Profile
  * Specifies data stored on a device for a BLE connection
  * Profile 1
    * Service A (i.e. Hearth rete in UUID format)
      * Characteristic
        * Value
        * Descriptor
      * Characteristic
        * Value
        * Descriptor
    * Service B (i.e. Blood pressure in UUID format)
      * Characteristic
        * Value
        * Descriptor
      * Characteristic
        * Value
        * Descriptor
  * Profile 2
    * â€¦
* Service
  * Structure

	attr handle	| (first handle id for the service)
	end grp handle	| (last handle id for the service)
	uuid 		| (first 8-digit from left hand side specifies service name)

  * All UUIDs and corresponding service names
    * Bluetooth SIG documentation https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/services
    * custom servises are not defined in here
* Characteristics
  * Structure
    * handle
    * char properties
    * char value handle
    * uuid
  * Value:Descriptor is a hex encoded ASCII data

* BLE authentication (association process)
  * Broadcaster device
    * broadcast to announce availability
    * collect and monitor data
  * Observer device
    * observe broadcasts
    * if it is an interested broadcast, send a connection request to the peripheral
  * Peripheral device
    * if peripheral accepts the request, observer and peripheral are connected
    * based on the pairing mechanism
    * data transmission starts each other
		
* Pairing mechanisms (Pairing encryption)
  * JustWorks (JW)
    * without display or small display without keyboard
    * key is 000000
  * Numeric comparison
    * shows the same number on both devices
    * asks for yes or no
  * Passkey
    * 6-digit passcode
    * (easy to brute force)
  * Out of band
    * shares the pin using an out of band channel like NFC

## 2. BLE pentest objectives
* Sniffing
* Reading
* Modifying characteristics (change behavior of the device by remotely controlling)

## 3. Interacting with BLE devices
* Plug in BLE adapter dongle on analysis computer
* Get Blootooth Address (BD_ADDR)
	
	`hciconfig`
* Search for BLE devices around (via hcitool or Blue Hydra)
	
	`hcitool lescan`
* Connect to target beacon (via Gatttool utility)
	
	`gatttool -I -b <beacon address>`
* List the BLE services
	
	`primary`
* List the service characteristics
	
	`characteristics`
* Read characteristics value and descriptor

	`char-read-hnd <char value handle>`
* Decode hex to ASCII

## 4. Modify data
* In order to modify something, functionality of the device is well-understand
* Then how these functionality is stored on device as values are identified
* Example I 
  * BLE devices disconnects from mobile application in every X seconds
  * Then re-connects again, this mechanism is known as heart-beat
  * If heartbeat does not happen, a notification appears or sound triggered 
  * Attacker may want to modify the connection time to unlimited
  * Therefore mobile app will not identify BLE device is stolen or broken
* Example II 
  * mobile app tracks the distance of an object
  * if it goes across the range, mobile app makes a buzzer
  * attacker may want to prevent buzzer not to notice owner
* List all handles

	`chr-desc <attr handle> <end group handle>`

* Check for Bluetooth SIG documentation (to understand functionality)
  * identify services defined by manufacturers and by SIG
* Read characteristics value and descriptor

	`char-read-hnd <char value handle>`

* Update characteristics value and descriptor
		
	`char-write-hnd <char value handle> <a char value same as to original format>`

## 5. Sniffing BLE traffic
* In order to understand the functionality of services defined by manufacturers
  * sniff the BLE traffic
  * press any buttons of the device to capture functionality
* Ubertooth One
  * download and install ubertooth utility
  * sniff traffic
	
	`ubertooth-btle -f -t <target device BD_ADDR>`
  * sniff traffic and dump into a pcap file

	`ubertooth-btle -f -t <target device BD_ADDR> - c ble-dump.pcap`
		
  * Relevant data

	Access address (AA)	| used to manage link layer
	Channel Index		| dedicated advertising channel
	Packet PDU Type	| ADV_IND ADV_DIRECT_IND ADV_NONCONN_IND ADV_SCAN_IND SCAN_REQ SCAN_RSP CONNECT_REQ
	AdvA	| 6-byte advertising address (usually BD_ADDR of the device)
	ScanA 	| 6-byte scanner address
			
  * Advertising PDUs

	ADV_IND	| Connectable Undirected Advertising
	ADV_DIRECT_IND	| Connectable Directed Advertising
	ADV_NONCONN_IND | Non-Connectable Undirected Advertising
	ADV_SCAN_IND	| Scannable Undirected Advertising
			
  * Scanning PDUs

	SCAN_REQ 	| Scan request from the mobile app
	SCAN_RSP	| Scan response from the target device
			
  * Initiating PDUs

	CONNECT_REQ	| Connection request
			
  * Wireshark
    * set DLT_USER (in Preferences > Protocols) to btle
    * filter only ATT packets

        `btl2cap.cid==0x004`

    * set DLT_USER (in Preferences > Protocols) to btle
    * filter Write requests
      * find the data is written to which Handle
    * examine the interested packet containing write request
      * BLE Link Layer
      * Bluetooth Attribute Protocol
        * Understand Value field
    * compare Value field of different packets to identify which bits change
      * the changed field are the user actions
    * determine your Value
			
  * Replay packet
    * BTLEJuice utility (web GUI)
      * sniffs/modifies/replays BLE packets
			
  * Write the value to the device
    * gatttool "char-write-req"
