# Language

It is important that the language in your report is well-formed. If you need writing assistance, kindly contact the [Centre for Academic Writing & Rhetoric](https://www.kth.se/en/biblioteket/skriva-referera/skrivande-retorik/centrum-for-akademiskt-skrivande-retorik-1.856488). They provide guideance and you may also [book an appointment for tutoring](https://www.kth.se/en/biblioteket/skriva-referera/skrivande-retorik/traffa-handledare). 

Note that non-fluent Swedish speakers probably will need some assistance with the compulsory Swedish thesis abstract, as the current state of machine translation still is not quite good enough.
