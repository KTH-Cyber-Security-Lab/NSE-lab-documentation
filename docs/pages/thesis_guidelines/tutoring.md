# Your tutor is not your examiner
While the examiner assesses your performance and thus acts in a role of authority, your tutor is only there to assist. Thus, interaction with your tutor is completely voluntary. Thus, if you feel confident that you are on the right track, then you don't need to participate in the activities below. If, on the other hand, you are not quite sure about the requirements on your project, or if you need technical, authoring or project planning assistance, then your tutor will try to help out.

# Synchronous tutoring meetings

During spring of 2021, Pontus Johnson offers videoconferencing tutoring meetings over Zoom every Friday at 09:00-10:00 for those who would like to meet synchronously. Some sessions may be cancelled or rescheduled. If so, that is communicated via ssas-students.slack.com. The Zoom meeting ID is 65208818819.

# Asynchronous tutoring

Beyond the weekly meeting, you may receive assistance from your supervisor over Slack (ssas-students.slack.com - ask your supervisor to register you if you are not already) or email. Much tutoring consists of reading and commenting on drafts of the thesis report. If you desire prompt feedback, please agree on a date for submitting your draft to your supervisor. That way, the supervisor can book the required reading time in the agenda, and thus provide very prompt feedback. Otherwise, response time will depend on how heavily booked the supervisor happens to be when the draft is received.

# Weekly update

A good way to keep in contact with your tutor - in particular if you didn't join the weekly Zoom meeting - is by submitting a weekly update (over ssas-students.slack.com or per e-mail), responding to these questions:
- What has happened since last update?
- What are your plans for the coming work?
- Do you need assistance?
