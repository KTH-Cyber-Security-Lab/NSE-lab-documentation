# Thesis Guidelines

Thesis projects will differ depending on your program. In particular, your will affect the number of credits, whether you can work in pairs, the kinds of plans and project specifications you will need to produce, presentation and opposition routines, and potential deadlines. For the actual content of the work, however, you will find a lot of information here. In brief, this is the process: 
1. [Register to the thesis project](registration.html).
1. [Decide on a system to investigate](https://nse.digital/pages/thesis_guidelines/choice_of_system.html). Sometimes, it is already decided what that system is, other times, you are free to suggest one to your supervisor. 
1. Procure the system. Sometimes KTH can order the device, but other times the process may be different. 
1. Write a project plan. The format of the project plan is oftentimes decided on by your program, but generally [the objectives](https://nse.digital/pages/thesis_guidelines/objective.html) will be the same for all hacking projects. Already at this point, it is a good idea to understand the [grading criteria](https://nse.digital/pages/thesis_guidelines/grading_criteria.html), as well as the structure of the tangible result of your work, i.e. your [thesis report](https://nse.digital/pages/thesis_guidelines/thesis_report.html).  
1. Start working according to your [method](https://nse.digital/pages/thesis_guidelines/method.html), making sure that you do not break [the law](https://nse.digital/pages/thesis_guidelines/the_law.html). If you need work space or tools, do check out the [Cyber Security Lab](https://nse.digital/pages/thesis_guidelines/lab.html).
1. During the project, you can receive [tutoring](https://nse.digital/pages/thesis_guidelines/tutoring.html) in different forms.
1. [Write the report](https://nse.digital/pages/thesis_guidelines/thesis_report.html), preferably in parallel to the actual work.
