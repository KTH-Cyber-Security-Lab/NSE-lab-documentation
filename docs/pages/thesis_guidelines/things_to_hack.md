# Things to hack

There are many potential targets for security assessments. Here are some suggestions: 

- Power grid asset management equipment
- Smart electricity meters
- SCADA control system equipment such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs)
- Open source IoT operating systems such as TinyOS, RIOT, Contiki, Mantis OS, Nano RK, LiteOS, FreeRTOS, Apache Mynewt, Zephyr OS, Ubuntu Core 16 (Snappy), ARM mbed, Yocto and Raspbian.
- [Google PlayStore](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/play-rewards/) 100M-user [apps](https://youtu.be/e9PdX-NmCSg). Google offers a bug bounty on the biggest apps, which also vouches for the legality of security testing them.

- [nRF9160](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Low-power-cellular-IoT/nRF9160) which is used in a lot of IoT devices. Explore with [Nordic Thingy:91](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Prototyping-platforms/Nordic-Thingy-91).
- [JetBrain's Code with Me](https://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2020/09/28/code-with-me-eap/). Jetbrains are a [suspected attack vector in the recent SolarWinds attack](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/justice-department-hit-russian-hackers/2021/01/06/d01cc6aa-5050-11eb-b96e-0e54447b23a1_story.html).
- Open source, like linux, nginx, apache, openssl, kvm, bash, vim, imagemagick, etc.
- Sport-related equipment, e.g. Garmin's sports watches, appear to feature [large attack surfaces](https://developer.garmin.com).
- Health-related equipment, such as blood glucose meters, even pace makers, if we can get a hold of one
- Smart power sockets and other home automation equipment
- [Smart glasses](https://www.ebay.com/b/Smart-Glasses/178894/bn_1642259)
- [VR headset](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Oculus-Standalone-Virtual-Reality-Headset/dp/B07D7HPSFC)
- [Robots](https://www.robotshop.com/eu/en/professional-service-robots.html)
- Baby monitors and similar home surveillance systems
- Internet-connected toys (dolls with microphones, etc.)
- Vehicle entertainment systems 
- [Headphones](https://threatpost.com/smart-ski-helmet-headphone-flaws-leak-personal-gps-data/142456/)
- Industrial IoT (Cranes, heavy machinery, trucks)
- [Smart refrigerators](https://www.elgiganten.se/cms/samsung-family-hub/samsung-family-hub-hemmets-nya-mittpunkt/)
- Connected pets? 
- [Smart car alarms](https://www.cnet.com/news/smart-alarms-left-3m-cars-vulnerable-to-hackers-who-could-turn-off-motors/)
- Vehicles, e.g. electronic scooters
- Electric mopeds (some come with GPS, smartphone apps and a kill switch, now-a-days).
- OBD II dongles used to connect your smart phone to your car
- Drones
- Robot vacuum cleaners (particularly interesting if they have a camera)
- Electronic door locks
- [Childrens' smart watches](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/05/eu-recalls-childrens-smartwatch-over-data-fears)
