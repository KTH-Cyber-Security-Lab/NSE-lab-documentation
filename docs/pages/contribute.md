# Contribute to docs

We encourage students and researchers to contribute documentation related to the lab that may be useful to others. To do this you should [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this website's [Github repository](https://github.com/KTH-Cyber-Security-Lab/NSE-lab-documentation), make your changes and then submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) on the orignal repository. Someone working at NSE will review your request and merge it so that it is published on this website.
